Circle is a MERN stack web application that I created(fully self-supervised), Summer 2018. The project helped me understand JSON data structure, full-stack development with deployment in the real-world, and plenty of JavaScript experience.

Cirlce is implemented using [MERN](http://mern.io/), a JavaScript application platform. The website has uses Validator and jwt tokens for login authentications. You can create/delete post and comments and also like each post and comments. This was done efficiently using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as a state management tool.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/ko/).
